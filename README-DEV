- While we could do the git submodule, dragging the whole of Vim for a few
  rarely-changing files feels like an overkill. So we just copy them from:

  https://github.com/vim/vim/tree/master/src/xxd

  The man page (xxd.1) is taken from the most recent Debian package.

- Note that upstream xxd --version prints the date of last change as its
  version while Debian uses the Vim version for the package version. We
  will follow Debian but will provide the date as upstream-version.
